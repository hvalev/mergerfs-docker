## Motivation
If you are here, then you are most likely looking for a simple solution to fuse multiple hard drives' contents to a single mountpoint using mergerfs and docker. There are multiple containers which dockerize mergerfs, however none are regularly updated, with open-sourced dockerfiles (no crypto-miners) and simple to use. This repository attempts to do just that. Simply mount your hard drives as volumes to ```/disks``` and mergerfs will make them available under ```/merged```. Exposing the ```/merged``` volume to host, you need to use ```:shared``` bind to share it between the container and host. Change the volume path on the host to your prefered location and that's it!


## How to run it
Docker run:
```
docker run -v /mnt/nd1:/disks/nd1 -v /mnt/nd2:/disks/nd2 -v /mnt/nd3:/disks/nd3 -v /mnt/merged:/merged:shared --device /dev/fuse --cap-add SYS_ADMIN -d hvalev/mergerfs
```
docker-compose:
```
version: "3.8"
services:
  mergerfs:
    image: hvalev/mergerfs:latest
    container_name: mergerfs
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    devices:
      - /dev/fuse:/dev/fuse
    volumes:
       - /mnt/nd1:/disks/nd1
       - /mnt/nd2:/disks/nd2
       - /mnt/nd3:/disks/nd3
       - /mnt/merged:/merged:shared
    restart: always
```

## Customizing
* If you would like to customize the mergerfs command with additional options, you can overwrite entrypoint.sh by mounting your own using an additional volume mount.
* If you would like to combine this with samba to share it over the network, you could also use a samba docker container.
